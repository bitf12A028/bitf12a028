           <p>The possibility of Karachi as a sea port was first noticed in the mid of 19th century and Sir 
               Henry Edward Frere who was appointed Commissioner of Sind after its annexation with Bombay in 
               1847 sought permission from Lord Dalhousie to begin survey of sea port. He also initiated the 
               survey for Railway line in 1858 . It was proposed that a railway line from Karachi City to Kotri, 
               steam navigation up the Indus /Chenab upto Multan and from there an other railway to Lahore and 
               beyond be constructed.</p>

           <p>It was on 13th May,1861 that first railway line was opened for public traffic between Karachi 
               City and Kotri, the distance of 105 miles. The line between Karachi City and Keamari was opened 
               on 16.6.1889.By 1897 the line from Keamari to Kotri was doubled.</p>
           <br />
           <p>The railway line from Peshawar to Karachi closely follows Alexander’s line of march through the 
               Hindu Kush to the sea. Different sections on existing main line from Peshawar to Lahore and Multan
                and branch lines were constructed in the last quarter of 19th century and early years of 20th 
               century.</p>

           <br />

           <p>The 4 sections i.e.Scinde railways, Indian Flotilla company Punjab railway and Delhi railways
                working in a single company were later on amalgamated into Scinde, Punjab & Delhi railways company
                and was purchased by the Secretary of State for India in 1885 and in January, 1886 it was named 
               North Western State Railways which was later on renamed as North Western Railways.</p>

           <br />

           <p>At the time of partition, North Western Railway’s 1847 route mile was transferred to India leaving 
               route miles 5048 to Pakistan. In 1954 The railway line was extended to Mardan and Charsada section
                and in 1956 Jacababad-Kashmore 2’-6’’ line was converted into broad gauge. Kot Adu-Kashmore line
                was constructed between 1969 to 1973 providing an alternate route from Karachi to up country.</p>
